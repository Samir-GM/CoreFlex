  <h3>Membership Activation and Access</h3>
  <p>At CoreFlex Gym, we offer quick and easy membership activation. Once you sign up online or in person, your membership is active immediately. You can access any of our facilities during staffed hours, and if you have a 24/7 membership, your personal access card allows entry at any time, day or night.</p>
  <p>Membership prices and promotions are listed in Australian Dollars (AU$) and will be charged at checkout. Please carry your access card when visiting the gym. Lost cards can be replaced at a small fee.</p>

  <h3>Class Bookings and Attendance</h3>
  <p>CoreFlex offers a wide range of fitness classes included in your membership. Class bookings can be made through our app or website. To ensure everyone has a chance to participate, we recommend booking early — spots are limited!</p>
  <p>If you can’t make it to a class, please cancel your booking at least 2 hours beforehand so others can join. Late cancellations or no-shows may result in a small fee or temporary booking restrictions.</p>

  <h3>Membership Cancellations and Freezes</h3>
  <p>We understand life can be unpredictable. CoreFlex offers flexible membership cancellations and freezes. You may freeze your membership for up to 3 months per year for medical, travel, or personal reasons. To cancel or freeze, please submit a request via our <a href="#">Membership Services</a> page or speak to our front desk team.</p>
  <p>All cancellation requests require a 14-day notice period. Terms may vary for promotional memberships; please check your membership agreement for specific details.</p>
